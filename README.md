 My Sample Code Submission for Connect Engineering Apprenticeship 2022

This sample code is a Number Game, where the goal of the game is to get the "red" side and "blue" side's sums are equal.

1.) Each time the program is run, the numbers are randomized 
2.) In order to enter in a number you have to click either the blue side button or red side button
3.) Once your done choosing numbers for each side, click enter and you will see if your sum is acctually equal. If equal: "Sucessful", If not: "Failed"
4.) Repeat until bored
